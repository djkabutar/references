# Many Worlds theory

Many world theory can be explained by the light interference, for that they have
proved light is not only particle, it is wave function, too.

The basic idea came from the double slit expeeriment done by the Young. References
for the double slit example:

From the experiment done by the veritasium, here is the youtube playlist which
tells the actual science behind many worlds theory.
