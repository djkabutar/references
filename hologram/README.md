# Hologram as an electric holography

All details about the holography topics:
[Overview of Hologram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8839869/)

Making an hologram using the electric holography is the hardest among the
all of others but to do so there should be a perfect light source as the
image was captured.

Image will be generated through the multiple light phases, every light phase
is a light source. Now to differentiate between 2D image and 3D image we 
need to capture the depth of the scene, too. To do that there are many items
which can be used such as lasers, excited states of the atoms, lenticular
lens, etc.

Refer the above document for the more details.
